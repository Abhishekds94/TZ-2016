This is done to avoid frequency interference between the two competing robots in the final round of the game.<br>
•	 The team must ensure that the potential difference across any two terminals must not exceed 24V. The machine can be powered electrically only.<br>
•	Batteries if on board must be sealed. Use of damaged batteries may lead to disqualification.<br>
•	 Use of IC engines in any form is not allowed.<br>
•	Robots should not damage the arena.<br>
•	 If your robot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the robot should be stacked as a single unit. The Wires should be properly insulated. The length of the wires must be at least 5m.<br><br>

<b>EVENT RULES:</b><br>
•	Three members of the team are allowed to stay around the arena.<br>
•	The track will consist of all the terrains like hills, mountains, lakes, sand and rough roads.<br>
•	The arena may consist of slopes, hilly terrain, mud pools, sand pits, liquefied tar, rocks, bumpy roads, ditches etc.<br>
•	The inclination will not be more than 40 degrees.<br>
•	There will be water barriers on the track. Hence, make sure your robot is water-proof.<br>
